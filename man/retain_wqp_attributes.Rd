\title{Restore WQP attributes after column removal}
\usage{
retain_wqp_attributes(data_full, data_reduced)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_full}{A data frame returned directly from the Water Quality
Portal (WQP) download function \code{dataRetrieval::readWQPdata()},
containing the full set of WQP attributes.}

\item{data_reduced}{A data frame derived from \code{data_full} with empty
columns removed (e.g., via \code{janitor::remove_empty("cols")}), which
has lost some or all of the original attributes.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same columns as \code{data_reduced} and the
  attributes from \code{data_full} restored where missing. The returned
  object preserves WQP metadata such as site information, variable
  descriptions, and request details.
}
\description{
This function restores attributes that are lost when empty columns are
removed from a Water Quality Portal (WQP) data download. It is intended
to be used after applying \code{janitor::remove_empty("cols")} (or similar)
to a WQP data frame, which drops important metadata stored as attributes
(e.g., site information, characteristic metadata, and request URLs).
}
\details{
The function copies attributes from the original full data frame and
re-attaches any attributes that are missing from the reduced data frame,
returning a data frame with fewer columns but the original WQP metadata
intact.
