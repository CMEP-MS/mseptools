\title{Retrieve Water Quality Portal (WQP) data for predefined Mississippi areas}
\usage{
get_wqp_data(
  area = c("watershedComplete", "3coastalCounties", "6coastalCounties",
    "basinCoastalStreams"),
  sampleMedia = "Water",
  service = "Result",
  dataProfile = "resultPhysChem",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{Character string specifying the spatial area to query.
Must be one of:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"watershedComplete"}}{complete Mississippi Sound Watershed, HUCs 0317 and 0318. May return data from Alabama and Louisiana as well as Mississippi.}
  \item{\code{"3coastalCounties"}}{Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock counties (MS)}
  \item{\code{"6coastalCounties"}}{Jackson, Harrison, Hancock, George,
    Stone, and Pearl River counties (MS)}
  \item{\code{"basinCoastalStreams"}}{MDEQ's Coastal Streams Basin: HUC 03170009}
}}

\item{sampleMedia}{Character string passed to
\code{dataRetrieval::readWQPdata()} specifying the sample media
(default is \code{"Water"}).}

\item{service}{Character string specifying the WQP service to query
(default is \code{"Result"}).}

\item{dataProfile}{Character string specifying the WQP data profile
(default is \code{"resultPhysChem"}, as this format includes method detection limit information).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed directly to
\code{dataRetrieval::readWQPdata()}, such as \code{startDateLo},
\code{startDateHi}, \code{characteristicName}, \code{characteristicType}
(anything you would put in 'Characteristic Group' in the WQP Advanced Query page to narrow down data types -
some desirable ones are \code{"Physical"}, \code{"Nutrients"}, \code{"Biological, Algae, Phytoplankton"},
\code{"Inorganic, Major, Metals"}, \code{"Inorganic, Minor, Metals"},
or \code{siteType}.  \strong{NOTE:} \code{characteristicType} \strong{DOES NOT WORK} with
complex areas like multiple HUCs or counties, even through the WQP site itself.
Inside this function, the \code{characteristicType} option only works with \code{area = "basinCoastalStreams"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing WQP results for the requested area. Empty columns are removed.
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{dataRetrieval::readWQPdata()} that simplifies
data retrieval for commonly used Mississippi Sound Estuary Program watershed, basin, and
coastal-county groupings. The function handles multi-county queries
internally and binds results into a single data frame.
}
\details{
This function preserves Water Quality Portal (WQP) metadata stored as
attributes on the returned data frame, even when empty columns are
removed during post-processing. As a result, the output can be passed
directly to \code{dataRetrieval::create_WQP_bib()} to generate an
appropriate data citation for the WQP query.
